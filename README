twitter_bootstrap
##################

This adds some public and template files to your pylons project so you have
access to Twitter's bootstrap.

Installation
============

To use:

* add twitter-bootstrap to setup.py as a dependency. Be sure to add it to your
  environment.

* Modify your config/environment.py

    * Add "import twitter_bootstrap" to the top

    * Change the line that reads:

        paths = dict(root=root,
                     controllers=os.path.join(root, 'controllers'),
                     static_files=os.path.join(root, 'public'),
                     templates=[os.path.join(root, 'templates')])

      to: 

        paths = dict(root=root,
                     controllers=os.path.join(root, 'controllers'),
                     static_files=[
                        os.path.join(root, 'public'),
                        twitter_bootstrap.public_path()],
                     templates=[
                        os.path.join(root, 'templates'),
                        twitter_bootstrap.template_path()])

* Modify config/middleware.py.

    * Change the lines that read:

        if asbool(static_files):
            # Serve static files
            static_app = StaticURLParser(config['pylons.paths']['static_files'])
            app = Cascade([static_app, app])

      to:
        
        if asbool(static_files):
            # Serve static files
            static_app = [
                StaticURLParser(path)
                for path in config['pylons.paths']['static_files']]
            app = Cascade(static_app+[app])



How Does It Work?
=================

You've modified your configuration so that when Pylons is looking for a
template or static content, it will first look in your template and static
content directories. If it can't find what it is looking for there, then it
will also look in twitter_bootstrap's template and static content directories.

NOTE CAREFULLY: If you create a template or static content with the same
relative file location as in twitter_bootstrap's, then you will override
twitter_bootstrap's. That could be a good or bad thing. I have put things into
the bootstrap directory to minimize the chance of a naming conflict.



Using the Basic Layouts
=======================

I have provided two layouts I find useful. One is a straightforward, barebones
HTML5 layout called bootstrap/html5.mako. The other is a simple website layout
with all the trappings you might need in most websites called
bootstrap/basic.mako. They contain documentation on how to use them.

If you have a similar layout you think would be universally useful, let me
know and I can incorporate it. If you think my defaults are terrible, I can
fix them to make them better. I hope to create something useful enough that
people actually use them in their finished projects, overriding minimally.
